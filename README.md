# Machine-Learning-Andrew-Ng-Coursera-Week-2-assignment
The main theme is to make people understand minute details of coding done in Machine Learning and meaning of Vectorization
Coding done above could have been done using loops as well but that takes more time and the act of processing all elements of an array simulatneously
Except the feature Normalization other codes are to make you complete your assignments for the grades but make sure you understand it first 
You might be confused in the feature Normalization Step as we have used std which actually gives standard deviation which is different than what Andrew Ng taught
The method taught in feature Normalization was min max normalization but if we divide X-mean(X) with standard deviation of X then it is called standardization which is also another way of feature scaling 
So, don't get confused over this
Happy Coding ;)
